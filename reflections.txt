We can use FC command to compare different files.
diff is a unix command

Different types of version control systems
google docs - all changessaved on drive
wiki - view history
Version control systems can help to track all changes and backup versions of files

Git - british sleng, unpleasant person. Also Version control systems - CVS, SVN, Mercurial
Commits in GIT are in other words checkpoints at wich we save our projects

git log - see the whole history
git diff - to compare 2 different files

it is better to commit one change at a time (for instance, if 2 bugs in 2 unrelated functions were
fixed). On the other hand to make a commit for every typo is too much

repository - a collection of files
git log --stat		some stats about changes in files
Git allows to save multiple files in one commit due to the reason that the modern approach to the software
development is to set a different file for a function, section or css, so GIT just saves the complex project
Use down arrow to scroll down in git bash

using GIT I can always return to previous versions and check what I've done before

I would like to use git to work on commits

Git init and git status commands. Git status command shows the state of the repository

I am going to add files with I am working on atm. Which I want to be present in the first commit. Imo it is better to add tracking to files on a step by step basis than to add them all at once as it is a more structured approach where you can control the process of transferring files from "not repository" to "indeed repository" and to control/feel how the work is moving forward.

Staging area is related to the commit when the working directory is not. git status is related to both (sa & wd)

Added the first commit
